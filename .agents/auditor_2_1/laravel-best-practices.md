# Laravel Best Practices Skill Dump

Best practices for Laravel, prioritized by impact.

## Consistency First
Before applying any rule, check what the application already does. Laravel offers multiple valid approaches — the best choice is the one the codebase already uses, even if another pattern would be theoretically better. Inconsistency is worse than a suboptimal pattern.

## Quick Reference

### 1. Database Performance
- Eager load with `with()` to prevent N+1 queries
- Enable `Model::preventLazyLoading()` in development
- Select only needed columns, avoid `SELECT *`
- `chunk()` / `chunkById()` for large datasets
- Index columns used in `WHERE`, `ORDER BY`, `JOIN`
- `withCount()` instead of loading relations to count
- `cursor()` for memory-efficient read-only iteration
- Never query in Blade templates

### 3. Security
- Define `$fillable` or `$guarded` on every model, authorize every action via policies or gates
- No raw SQL with user input — use Eloquent or query builder
- `{{ }}` for output escaping, `@csrf` on all POST/PUT/DELETE forms, `throttle` on auth and API routes
- Validate MIME type, extension, and size for file uploads
- Never commit `.env`, use `config()` for secrets, `encrypted` cast for sensitive DB fields

### 9. Queue & Job Patterns
- `retry_after` must exceed job `timeout`; use exponential backoff `[1, 5, 10]`
- `ShouldBeUnique` to prevent duplicates; `ShouldBeUniqueUntilProcessing` for early lock release
- Always implement `failed()`; with `retryUntil()`, set `$tries = 0`
- `RateLimited` middleware for external API calls; `Bus::batch()` for related jobs
- Horizon for complex multi-queue scenarios
