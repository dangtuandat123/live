# Laravel Best Practices

Best practices for Laravel, prioritized by impact. Each rule teaches what to do and why. For exact API syntax, verify with `search-docs`.

## Consistency First

Before applying any rule, check what the application already does. Laravel offers multiple valid approaches — the best choice is the one the codebase already uses, even if another pattern would be theoretically better. Inconsistency is worse than a suboptimal pattern.

Check sibling files, related controllers, models, or tests for established patterns. If one exists, follow it — don't introduce a second way. These rules are defaults for when no pattern exists yet, not overrides.

## Quick Reference

### 1. Database Performance → `rules/db-performance.md`

- Eager load with `with()` to prevent N+1 queries
- Enable `Model::preventLazyLoading()` in development
- Select only needed columns, avoid `SELECT *`
- Index columns used in `WHERE`, `ORDER BY`, `JOIN`
- `withCount()` instead of loading relations to count
- `cursor()` for memory-efficient read-only iteration
- Never query in Blade templates

### 2. Advanced Query Patterns → `rules/advanced-queries.md`

- `addSelect()` subqueries over eager-loading entire has-many for a single value
- Dynamic relationships via subquery FK + `belongsTo`
- Conditional aggregates (`CASE WHEN` in `selectRaw`) over multiple count queries
- `setRelation()` to prevent circular N+1 queries
- `whereIn` + `pluck()` over `whereHas` for better index usage
- Two simple queries can beat one complex query
- Compound indexes matching `orderBy` column order
- Correlated subqueries in `orderBy` for has-many sorting (avoid joins)

### 3. Security → `rules/security.md`

- Define `$fillable` or `$guarded` on every model, authorize every action via policies or gates
- No raw SQL with user input — use Eloquent or query builder
- `{{ }}` for output escaping, `@csrf` on all POST/PUT/DELETE forms, `throttle` on auth and API routes
- Validate MIME type, extension, and size for file uploads
- Never commit `.env`, use `config()` for secrets, `encrypted` cast for sensitive DB fields

### 4. Caching → `rules/caching.md`

- `Cache::remember()` over manual get/put
- Cache tags to invalidate related groups
- `Cache::add()` for atomic conditional writes
- `once()` to memoize per-request or per-object lifetime
- `Cache::lock()` / `lockForUpdate()` for race conditions

### 5. Eloquent Patterns → `rules/eloquent.md`

- Correct relationship types with return type hints
- Local scopes for reusable query constraints
- Global scopes sparingly — document their existence
- Attribute casts in the `casts()` method
- Cast date columns, use Carbon instances in templates
- `whereBelongsTo($model)` for cleaner queries
- Never hardcode table names — use `(new Model)->getTable()` or Eloquent queries

### 6. Validation & Forms → `rules/validation.md`

- Form Request classes, not inline validation
- Array notation `['required', 'email']` for new code; follow existing convention
- `$request->validated()` only — never `$request->all()`
- `Rule::when()` for conditional validation

### 7. Configuration → `rules/config.md`

- `env()` only inside config files
- `App::environment()` or `app()->isProduction()`
- Config, lang files, and constants over hardcoded text

### 8. Testing Patterns → `rules/testing.md`

- `LazilyRefreshDatabase` over `RefreshDatabase` for speed
- `assertModelExists()` over raw `assertDatabaseHas()`
- Factory states and sequences over manual overrides
- Use fakes (`Event::fake()`, `Exceptions::fake()`, etc.) — but always after factory setup, not before

### 9. Queue & Job Patterns → `rules/queue-jobs.md`

- `retry_after` must exceed job `timeout`; use exponential backoff `[1, 5, 10]`
- `ShouldBeUnique` to prevent duplicates
- Always implement `failed()`; with `retryUntil()`, set `$tries = 0`

### 10. Routing & Controllers → `rules/routing.md`

- Implicit route model binding
- Scoped bindings for nested resources
- `Route::resource()` or `apiResource()`
- Methods under 10 lines — extract to actions/services
- Type-hint Form Requests for auto-validation

### 11. HTTP Client → `rules/http-client.md`

- Explicit `timeout` and `connectTimeout` on every request
- `retry()` with exponential backoff for external APIs
- Check response status or use `throw()`

### 12. Events, Notifications & Mail → `rules/events-notifications.md`

- Event discovery over manual registration; `event:cache` in production
- `ShouldDispatchAfterCommit` / `afterCommit()` inside transactions
- Queue notifications and mailables with `ShouldQueue`

### 13. Error Handling → `rules/error-handling.md`

- `report()`/`render()` on exception classes or in `bootstrap/app.php` — follow existing pattern
- structured context via `context()` on exception classes

### 14. Task Scheduling → `rules/scheduling.md`

- `withoutOverlapping()` on variable-duration tasks
- `onOneServer()` on multi-server deployments

### 15. Architecture → `rules/architecture.md`

- Single-purpose Action classes; dependency injection over `app()` helper
- Prefer official Laravel packages and follow conventions, don't override defaults

### 16. Migrations → `rules/migrations.md`

- Generate migrations with `php artisan make:migration`
- `constrained()` for foreign keys
- Never modify migrations that have run in production
- Add indexes in the migration, not as an afterthought
- Mirror column defaults in model `$attributes`

### 17. Collections → `rules/collections.md`

- Higher-order messages for simple collection operations
- `lazyById()` when updating records while iterating

### 18. Blade & Views → `rules/blade-views.md`

- `$attributes->merge()` in component templates
- Blade components over `@include`

### 19. Conventions & Style → `rules/style.md`

- Follow Laravel naming conventions for all entities
- Prefer Laravel helpers over raw PHP functions
